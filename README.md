## Health Savings Experiments

To understand why those who are low income are constrained in their ability to save for investments in
preventative health, researchers designed a field experiment in rural Kenya in which they randomly varied
access to four innovative saving technologies. By observing the impact of these various technologies on asset
accumulation, and by examining which types of people benefit most from them, the researchers were able to
identify key barriers to saving.

They worked with 113 ROSCAs (Rotating Savings and Credit Associations). A ROSCA is a group of
individuals who come together and make regular cyclical contributions to a fund (called the “pot”), which
is then given as a lump sum to one member in each cycle. In their experiment, the researchers randomly
assigned 113 ROSCAs to one of the five study arms. In this exercise, we will focus on three study arms (one
control and two treatment arms). The data file, rosca.csv is extracted from their original data, excluding
individuals who have received multiple treatments for the sake of simplicity.

Individuals in all study arms were encouraged to save for health and were asked to set a health goal for
themselves at the beginning of the study. In the first treatment group (Safe Box), respondents were given a
box locked with a padlock, and the key to the padlock was provided to the participants. They were asked
to record what health product they were saving for and its cost. This treatment is designed to estimate the
effect of having a safe and designated storage technology for preventative health savings.

In the second treatment group (Locked Box), respondents were given a locked box, but not the key to the
padlock. The respondents were instructed to call the program officer once they had reached their saving
goal, and the program officer would then meet the participant and open the Locked Box at the shop where
the product is purchased. Compared to the safe box, the locked box offered stronger commitment through
earmarking (the money saved could only be used for the specified purpose selected by the participant) but
less control of funds by the participant.
